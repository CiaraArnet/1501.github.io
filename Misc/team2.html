<h2>Ethical issues relating to the technology, your personal reflections and recommendations </h2>

<h4><em>While the safety and security behind tracing apps should be researched and further investigated, I believe that they are of huge importance to the user as they can quickly find who they have been in contact with and whether there is reasonable cause for concern, allowing the user accurate information on time and place. This is a massive benefit as the app can serve to speed up the time taken to recover from a pandemic, lowering the societal impact and allowing individuals to return to a normal routine. However, as applications such as the NZ COVID tracer app require sensitive information in order to properly work, many may be wary to use these apps, a major concern for the effectiveness of the app. I believe that by encouraging proper use of tracking applications and ensuring the safety and privacy of the userâ€™s data, issues surrounding this matter would hopefully be minimized. This would allow more high spread usage of the app, quickening the recovery process for all which be a large benefit to our society.  </em></h4><br>
