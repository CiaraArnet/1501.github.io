<h4><em>I believe that the Location tracking apps are extremely useful. They have prevented longer and harder lockdowns as people have been able to provide their location quickly and efficiently through these apps, 
where people are also then notified if they are considered a close contact or a casual contact. As these apps somewhat secure as they delete your stored data after 30 days and the data is stored on your phone,
 meaning no one will have access to the data unless they have access to your phone. There are many options to track location and are also further ways these can be adapted to help with COVID around the world. 
 Therefore, I believe that these location tracking apps are useful and successful if used correctly and impacts society in a positive way. .</em></h4><br>
