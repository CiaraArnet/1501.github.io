<h2>Ethical issues relating to the technology, your personal reflections and recommendations </h2>

<p>The rapid increase in COVID-19 cases and deaths in affected countries shows how unprepared the world truly is. Unexpected things happen all the time, but I do believe we can utilize emerging technologies to add to our line of defense against a global pandemic. Technologies such as, Bluetooth, Global Positioning System(GPS), wireless technology, wearable technology and sensors. We shouldn’t make closing down borders our main shield from the virus but instead make it an initial step to give us time to prepare how we’re going to deal with it. Enabling border security to have access to a traveling passenger’s health records could help stop people who are positive with a contagious virus to enter the country and that would help lessen the chances of an outbreak overall. All of this comes with a big risk, the main one being privacy data breaches and potential leak of private information. I do believe that with research and proper risk management should suffice and the positives will outweigh the negatives overall. </p>
