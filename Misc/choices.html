</ul><h2>The New Zealand Covid Tracer App </h2>
<p>There are a few apps that exist with tracking location. In New Zealand, there is the Covid Tracer App, which was created by the New Zealand Government to help with contact tracing.It uses QR codes, which are compulsory for all businesses to
have and be accessible, to sign in and Bluetooth to track who's nearby you. The New Zealand Government also has made it compulsory that everybody uses the scanning or manually signing in during alert Levels 4, 3 and 2, and it is not compulsory
during level 1,  However, the government still requests that you still sign in regularly. According to stats on the Ministry of Health Website (Ministry Of Health New Zealand, 2021), in the first day of the application being released which was
the 19th of May, over 92,000 people had installed the application. And on an average since the application was first released to the public, there has been an average of 738,00 scans a day. These statistics shows that the application is being
used and that if an outbreak would happen, we could easily contact people who were close contacts to the cases. 
 <br>"Contact alerts mean that you can: <br>
	<ul>
<li>receive a location alert if you scanned the QR code for a location at around the same time it was visited by a confirmed or probable case of COVID-19</li>
<li>receive a Bluetooth alert if you have been near another app user who tests positive for COVID-19 (you'll also need to turn on Bluetooth tracing).</li>
	</ul> " 
<br>(Ministry Of Health New Zealand, 2021) <br>
 The app will notify you when you have been in contact with a case or a probable case, this is useful because then people are able to self-isolate and get tested, making outbreaks smaller and less likely to cause a major lockdown. <br>
 This is good because it is positively affecting society, as less outbreaks occurring will have less effect on people’s mental health, businesses, tourism and Government. This is the best option to track location. As every business 
 has a QR code displayed, the Bluetooth which is useful if you have forgotten to sign in to a place and someone there was contagious, you will be notified, the government has access to this information and you will be contacted fast
 and efficiently if you have come into contact with someone who is a case or a potential case.
<br></p>
<h2>Signing in Manually </h2>
<p>
The second main alternative to using the app is to manually sign in using pen and paper and the provided forms to fill out. This is not very safe as the information you write down includes your email address, your home address and your contact number
 and anyone is able to look at the information you have written down as the sheet is available to anybody, to also write down on. This is why it is more recommended to use the Covid Tracer app. This alternative is here for people who might not have
 the app installed due to their device being too outdated, or if their phone is flat or even if they had forgotten their phone.
<br>
</p>
<h2>AUT QR Scanning </h2>
<p>
AUT has QR scanning within their AUT app where they recommend every student and Lecturer signs in and out of every building they enter. This is useful as it is able to accurately get the times you entered and left the building, whereas the covid tracer
 app does not predict the time you have left a store after you leave unless you sign into another place. <br>
 "The QR code system makes a record of the location, time, date and student/staff identity number, which is securely stored in our AUT systems for up to 30 days. " (AUT, n.d.) <br>
The app will know your location, time and date of where you were when you scanned the QR code. This meaning that if someone was in the area at the same time as you who has COVID, You will be notified, which is the same as the COVID tracer app, by the 
New Zealand Government, However, AUT has it for more accurate times and locations which can be useful as if a breakout was to occur in the university, they can contact who was in the building/s at the same time as the person who was contagious.<br>
 AUT also deletes the data after 30 days which makes your location data only temporarily stored. This is a good option to use as if you are a student of AUT and frequently move around the university, as it can pinpoint if you did come in contact with
 another student who is a case or probable case and if you weren't in the same areas as them at or near the same time as them you would not necessarily have to go into quarantine. This has a positive effect on society as your data will less likely be
 stolen, which will make people feel more safe and secure, more accurate at knowing your location, your arrival time of entering a building and when you left the building.
 </p>
<h2>Google Maps Timeline Feature </h2>
<p>
There is also Google maps, which tracks your location and is fairly accurate, with minor issues that you might have to go and change like specific locations you were at as this uses GPS signals to figure out where you are, and it's not always accurate.
 A study that looked at Googles timeline feature, (Rodriguez, Tiberius, van Bree, & Geradts, 2018) it showed that google wasn’t always the best at locating the mobile device, <br>
 “This figure shows that GPS has the highest hit ratio (52% of hits), followed by 3G, then 2G and the latest is Wi-Fi with only 7% of hits. This low hit ratio in Wi-Fi is because Google is too optimistic when calculating locations using Wi-Fi networks.” <br>
 This shows that the google timeline isn't always accurate and as there’s not many success hits, it might not be the best at using this to track your location. As Google Maps Timeline also doesn’t share your location to the government,there would be no way to 
 know if you were a close contact until the government releases the information on where the cases or probable cases were and at what times assuming they were scanning in or could remember where they had been in the last 7 – 14 days. Ultimately, this is not the 
 best option to use to track your location.  <br>
<br>
</p>
<h2>Other Countries Covid Tracer Apps </h2>
<p>
Other countries also have their own Covid tracing app, such as Australia’s COVIDSafe, Austria’s Stopp Corona, But most of them only use the Bluetooth tracking. A few such as Honk Hong’s LeaveHomeSafe and have QR codes, However, the New Zealand’s Covid Tracer App uses 
QR codes as well as Bluetooth, thus making it more effective for tracking and locating people.  <br>
<br>
</p>
<h3>Australia’s COVIDSafe App </h3>
<p>
Australia’s COVIDSafe uses Bluetooth to virtually high five people you’ve become in contact with within 1 meter. This is useful as if someone tests positive you can find out it you are considered a close contact or not, just like the New Zealand app, However, 
they do not have QR codes to scan in. COVIDSafe can allow you to request for your data to be deleted, and it will automatically be deleted after 21 days. <br>
“When the Minister for Health declares the COVID-19 pandemic over, users will be prompted to delete the app from their phone. This will delete all app information on a person’s phone. The information contained on the highly secure information storage system will also be destroyed at the end of the pandemic.” (Australian Goverment, n.d.)<br>
 As the pandemic ends, they are telling everyone to uninstall the app, which is good as it will clear all of the data that is saved, meaning there wont be any risks of data breaching.
<br>
</p>
<h3>Austria’s Stopp Corona App</h3>
<p>
The Stopp Corona App is similar to the Australia’s Covid safe in the way that it only uses Bluetooth to track who you have into contact with. However, The Stopp Corona does have a questionnaire in the app to track symptoms <br>
“The app also offers a clinically tested questionnaire, which allows you to assess your health status on a daily basis.” (Austrian Red Cross, 2020)<br>
 this is useful as you are able to track your symptoms and if anything unusual appears, you are able to notice as you might have not had that symptom the previous day. The questionnaire is a good idea to add into the Stopp Corona application as it is useful
 to keep track of symptoms that you may potentially have, which could also make trips to the testing centers or doctors more useful as you can say when the symptoms started rather than estimating.
<br>
</p>
<h3> Honk Hong’s LeaveHomeSafe App </h3>
<p>
The LeaveHomeSafe app allows you to scan in using QR codes into venues,  and also has codes inside of taxi’s as well, so you can track your location more. The LeaveHomeSafe app also has a “Leave” button which records your leaving time of the venue or taxi.
 This is useful as it can get your arrival time and you leaving time, which can be crucial to finding out if you are safe or not from a contact who has been in the same area as you. Also, this app does not require you to sent them any information. It all stays anonymous<br>
 “After downloading the “LeaveHomeSafe” mobile app, the public can use the app immediately without the need to register any personal information. On entering a venue, users can use the app to record their visits by scanning the venue QR code. The visit records will be encrypted and stored in users’ mobile app. Comparison of visit records and notification function will only be carried out in users’ mobile phone. Such data will not be stored in any government or other systems and will be automatically erased after 31 days. “ (Office of the Government Chief Information Officer, 2021)<br>
 This shows that the citizens aren’t required to send any information they don’t want the government knowing. This also makes the application more private as if there is no personalized data, there is no way someone hacking will be able to gather anything about anyone on
 the app who has not got any data saved.
